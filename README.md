# Bibliography reviewed

I am interested tu study the opportunities of the people of New York; to see
how important is race, religion, income and -also- the place of born in the city.
Is there a difference of being borned in one neighborhood or another, Is this matters?
For this porpuse, I read two different documents. The first one is an online publication in
the Graduate Center titled "Communities of interest in NYC", and it oulines how communities 
are distributed geographicaly and how racial characteristics are relatated with income, access to
public services, education and -also- in how people participate in politics; political preferencias, etc.

The second document that I read was a study made by the Centro Espinosa-Yglesias, a mexican think tank
for social movility studies, which shows the probabilities to be poor (and also remain poor) by state 
of birth. This is very interesting because there are regions in Mexico where people are born condemned to be poor.
If we compare the north and south, differences are abysmal; it's like having two different countries.
